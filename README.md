Project Overview
This Decentralized Application (DApp) demonstrates a banking escrow model using Solidity, Remix IDE, Ganache, and MetaMask.  
It represents a blockchain-based escrow service where a bank acts as an arbiter between a sender and receiver, providing a transparent and secure transaction process.
Tech Stack
- Solidity (Remix IDE) — Smart contract logic  
- Ganache — Local blockchain for testing  
- MetaMask — Wallet & transaction signing    
- GitHub — Version control   
Objectives
- Design a blockchain solution for Banking & Financial Services.
- Implement an Escrow Smart Contract for peer-to-peer transactions.
- Demonstrate security via cryptography (ECDSA, Keccak256).
- Document and present results in a poster and reflection report.
